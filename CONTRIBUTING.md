# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:
- Using the issue tracker, and
- Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.


## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request. 

Guidelines:
- Whenever you make a new viewcontroller use stackviews for the elements on the page
- Use whatever button images are provided and match the color scheme. In this case it should be simple white and blue apple default. It is subject to change
- For Stylistic and Architectural decisions, mimic the styles and patterns in the existing code-base.
