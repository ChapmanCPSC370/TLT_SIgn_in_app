#TLT SIgn in app

An iOS (and potentially later Android too) app that allows students to sign into SI sessions with their phone.

For the students: They input their full name and ID number. Then they select which SI they are currently attending.

For the SI's: They input their full name and ID number. If it matches a person in our list of SI's they are confirmed and can add sessions. The sessions they add enter a list in which the students can then search and select from.
