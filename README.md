#TLT SIgn in app



-For the students: They input their full name and ID number. Then they select which SI they are currently attending.

-For the SI\'92s: They input their full name and ID number. If it matches a person in our list of SI\'92s they are confirmed and can add sessions. They add their sessions one time for the whole semester and it goes to a list which the students can then search and select from.
